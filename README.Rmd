> Currently under development. 



`datacleanr` is a flexible and efficient tool for **interactive** data cleaning, and is inherently interoperable, as it seamlessly integrates into **reproducible** data analyses pipelines in `R`.

It can deal with nested **tabular**, as well as **spatial** and **time series** data.





## Installation

You can install the development version of `datacleanr`  with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("the-hull/datacleanr")
```

## Design

`datacleanr` is developed using the [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) package, and relies on informative summaries, visual cues and interactive data selection and anntoation.
All data-altering operations are documented, and converted to valid `R` code (**reproducible recipe**), that can be copied, sent to an active `RStudio` script, or saved to disk.

There are **four tabs** in the app for these tasks:

- **Set-up & Overview**: define nesting structure based on (multiple) groups.
- **Filtering**: use `R` expression to filter/subset data.
- **Visual Cleaning and Annotating**: generate bivarirate (time series) plots and maps, as well as highlight and annotate individual observations. Cycle through nested groups to expedite exploration and cleaning. Histograms of original vs. 'cleaned' data can be generated.
- **Extract**: generate reproducible recipe and define outputs.

Note, maps require columns *lon* and *lat* (X and Y) in decimal degrees in the data set to render.

## Additional features

- **Grouping**: the grouping defined in the "Set-up and Overview" tab is carried forward through the app. These groups can be used to cycle through nested/granular data, and considerably speed up exploration and cleaning. These groups are also available for filtering (Filtering tab), where filter expressions can be scoped to group level (i.e. no groups, individual, all groups).
- **Interoperability**: 
  when a logical (`TRUE`\\`FALSE`) column named `.dcrflag` is present, corresponding observations are rendered with different symbols in plots and maps. Use this feature to validate or cross-check external quality control or outlier flagging methods.


## Demonstration

Launch `datacleanr`'s interactive app with the following code:

```{r example, eval = FALSE}
library(datacleanr)
dcr_app(iris)
## basic example code
```
